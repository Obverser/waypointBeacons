A simple beacon based, rpg-like waypoint system. First attempt at a Spigot/Paper plugin.

Not very advanced, but it's good enough. Feel free to take the source code, jar files are available for download.
Config files have to be made manually because I don't know how to make them automatically.

Java and Paper API are required.
Made with ItelliJ IDEA CE, using Minecraft Development Plugin.

Thanks for checking this out! Have fun.
